We are all worthy of care.

## Open the meeting

Welcome to Cambridge Care Collective!  Thanks for coming.
This meeting will be 40 min long, and will end abruptly, so we'll try to close before we get kicked off. 

Do a round of introductions if there are new folks. 

Before we start, we agree to confidentiality and kindness.  Kindness is twofold, firstly to have the intention of care and kindness with our speech, and secondly to assume this intention of each other.  Please indicate that you agree.

## Listening exercises

We will now move into listening to each other.  Everyone will have N minutes set aside for them, and everyone else will direct their care and attention towards the person.  You can talk about how things are going for you right now, your experience becoming disabled or learning you're disabled, or anything else that's on your mind.  You don't have to speak or fill your whole time, we can just sit with you in loving silence.  After people speak, we can thank them, give a smile or words of support, but we only give advice if they explicitly ask for it afterwards.  

* With 3 people, 6 minutes each
* With 4 people, 5 minutes each

## Advice

Let the conversation continue, ask if anyone has specific things they want to talk about.
