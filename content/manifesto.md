We are all worthy of care.

## Why we think we're not

Confronting our vulnerability makes us feel uncomfortable.  It runs counter to centuries of programming to realise we are human, not machines that can run constantly at full speed in the service of the economy.

## Beauty in slowness

There is real beauty and intrinsic value in our slow, awkward, crip ways of being. 

We continue to be failed by our society that tries to reject the idea of society itself. 
We know that we are stronger together and that growing strong communities is the way we will thrive. We need to develop models of care that extend outside the family and outside of our formal institutions.  

This group is a first step in this direction.
