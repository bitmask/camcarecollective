We are a pan-disability peer support group centered in Cambridge, UK that meets weekly online. We hold facilitated meetings where we provide space to listen to each other share our experiences. We welcome newly disabled people to disability, and provide the care, support, community, and love that is so often missing from our ableist society.  

We welcome new members who self identify as disabled in any way: through physical, mental, or invisible disability or neurodivergence, and who consider themselves disabled under the social or medical models of disability.
